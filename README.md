# cycleFitMAUI
.Net MAUI app with Blazor that allows you to create cycling workout files (.FIT) using the Garmin Fit SDK. You can then upload the file to your bike computer or training software.

## Reason for Building
I bought a Hammerhead Karoo 2 bike computer and their software doesn't include creating bike workouts. After searching for software that did I found that trainingpeaks worked really well, but you had to pay to plan workouts more than a day out in advance and you couldn't download them. This inspired me to make a cycling workout creator that's free and easy to use :)

## Ulterior Motive for Building ðŸ˜ˆ
I wanted to sharpen up my modern dotnet development skillset and try my hand at creating a desktop application that uses web technology ðŸ¤ª
